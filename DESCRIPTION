Title: Attribute-Wise Learning for Scoring Outliers (ALSO) using Random Forests
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Danny", "Morris", email = "usc00@hotmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: ALSO is an anomaly detection algorithm that uses predictive models
    to produce outlier scores. For a given dataset, separate models are fit for
    each feature. In each model, one feature is the target and the remaining features
    are predictors. Observations that consistently deviate from expected (predicted) 
    values across the individual models are scored highly and may represent 
    outliers/anomalies. This package uses random forests (from the ranger package)
    to build individual regressors and/or classifiers.
